account_description,"The account description is a category associated with the vendor or transaction and is typically assigned by the finance liaison within a specific department. However, if the finance liaison does not assign an account code, the system defaults to the account code set at the vendor level if available. This can sometimes lead to variations for how spending is classified at the transaction level and should be interpreted with caution. For example, a purchase from a print vendor could be assigned the account of 'Printing Services' at the vendor level, even if the actual purchase is for something other than a printer. Additionally, the category 'Misc. Purchased Services' can have a range of uses by departments when no other category is an appropriate fit. Examples of possible expenses in the 'Misc. Purchased Services' category could include a large contract that supports a portion of the overhead for an external organization, or smaller payments such as service contracts for routine department services."
